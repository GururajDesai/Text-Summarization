# Text-Summarization

An LSTM based seq2seq (Encoder-decoder) language model to predict summaries for natural language data. Wikihow data was used to develop the model. 

### Abstract
Text summarizing can be used to automatically create short summaries of longer text. In the age of the internet, we are constantly
bombarded with a lot of information where you can lose the overview quickly. Extractive and abstractive text summarization are
of great help to come up with short summaries of the given text. The extractive approach focuses on the relevant sentences in
the document according to some certain criteria. The abstractive approach tries to increase the coherence among the sentences
through the elimination of redundancies and clarification of the content of the sentences. This paper describes the modelling of an LSTM for extractive text summarization.
